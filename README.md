Description:
Het Depot is a console-application for the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen, the first publicly accessible art depot in the world, located next to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. The application allows visitors to sign up for guided tours and also collects data for data analysis.

As a part of a school project, our team of four members worked on developing the application. My main contribution to the project was the implementation of controllers for the museum guide feature, following the View Model design pattern, as well as JSON read/write methods used in the services.

In collaboration with my team members, we designed and developed the controllers to handle user interactions and manage the flow of data between the user interface and the underlying data model. Throughout the project, we worked together to refine the functionality and ensure a seamless user experience.

By adopting the View Model design pattern, we were able to separate the concerns of the user interface and the data model, resulting in a well-structured and maintainable codebase. This approach enabled us to easily modify and extend the museum guide feature as needed, facilitating future enhancements to the application.

Working as a team, we successfully implemented the controllers for the museum guide feature, contributing to the overall functionality and usability of the Het Depot application.
